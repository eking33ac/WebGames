<!-- Maybe have the home page be thre pannels: 
 One for basic programming beginner things like a vowel counter
 One for apps that are not games
 One for apps that ARE games
 Put these in a flex box

 After that, have the games/apps appear underneath from all sections, however I have them load in

 Nav at the top: Home, About, and a link to Projects(things which took more effort and possibly information pages and github links to other projects)

 About: Github link, Major, maybe other stuff?

 Page for study materials or things I use to learn????
