    <h2>About Page</h2><br>
    <p>This is my personal project, made in part for a class but mostly for my own development journy.</p>
    <p>I am currently a college student majoring in Computer Information Systems (CIS). I love website programming, and this site exists so I can practice!</p>
    <p>It was first created in early April 2025. I have many goals for this website, and you can likely see it is in the early stages right now!</p>
    <p>Know that, for now, if you submit any forms or make changes to any games, this website does not save them. It will reload without any of your information next time.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being here!</p>
