User Flow:
Users using your application have certain expectations.
Common questions:
    Where can I find my cart?
    Where can I learn more about this tool?
    I wanna know if I can trust this site.
    Where is the sign-up button?
Users are looking for info, want to buy something, or just using the service.


User Flow Diagram:
Map out the main journey from the moment the user lands on the site until their goal is achieved.
 E.g.
    entry -> view products -> add to cart -> purchase -> success
    landing -> learn how it works -> find category -> select category -> view design inspirations

Wire Framing: 
Create pages/screens for each step on the user flow diagram.
Each page should contribute to the goal a user has when entering the site. (i.e. the purchase, finding their category, etc. Just before the success stage.)

For a user shopping for something, there may be pages for: Store, product, cart, payment, and success/purchase
Wireframes are the drawn layout for diffrent pages on the website, before any coding is acutally done.

Design Categories:
buttons, grids, scroll bars, links, drop down menus, loading animations, cursors, progress bars, toggle switches, etc.
